reverse1([] , []) .  % the empty list is already reversed.
reverse1([X] , [X]) .  % a list of 1 item is already reversed. This special case is, strictly speaking, optional, as it will be handled by the general case.
reverse1([X|Xs] , R) :- % The general case, a list of length >= 1 , is reversed by
reverse1(Xs,T),        % - reversing its tail, and
append(T, [X], R).  % - appending its head to the now-reversed tail
